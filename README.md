This project was initally designed to navigate through and visualize the contents of the LCBO API repository. LCBO stands for "Liquor Control Board of Ontario", a corporation that retails and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout the Canadian province of Ontario. Since the LCBO API has recently been converted to an open source project, I have kept the website's framework and downloaded only a sample of data per category and type of product.
You can read more about it here --> https://lcboapi.com/news/lcbo-api-is-now-open-source-software/. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
